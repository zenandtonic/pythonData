# PROBLEM 1
# Create a variable that holds the value of your first name.


# PROBLEM 2
# Create a variable that holds the value of your favorite number.


# PROBLEM 3
# Create a variable that holds a boolean value representing if your hair is brown.


# PROBLEM 4
# Print your first name, by printing the variable created in problem 1.


# PROBLEM 5
#  Create a variable called `loves_code` and set it equal to true. 
#  Check to see if `loves_code` is equal to true or false. 
#  If it is true, print "I love to code!"
#  If it is not, print "Coding has it's challenges."


# PROBLEM 6
# Create an array called `colors` and set it equal to a list of at least five colors.


# Problem 7
# Using bracket syntax, print out the last item in your colors array.


# For problems 8-9, use the following line of code:
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Problem 8
# Use a for-in loop to iterate over the `numbers` array and print each number.


# Problem 9
# Create an empty array called `even_numbers`.
# Use a for-in loop to iterate over the `numbers` array, and if a number is even, add  it to the `even_numbers` array.


# Problem 10
# Do not edit the code below.
score = 74
# Do not edit the code above.

# Determine if the letter grade of the given variable 'score'. If the variable is a 90 or above, console-log an 'A', between 80 and 89, console-log a 'B', between 70 and 79, 'C', between 60 and 69, 'D', and anything below 60 should console-log an 'F'.


# Problem 11
# Create a variable called 'changeMyMind' and set it equal to true. 
# Check to see if changeMyMind is set to true or false, if it is true, change the status to false, if it is false, change the status to true.


# ADVANCED

# For problems 12-15, use the following line of code:
friends = ['Joe', 'Sally', 'Camilo', 'Perry', 'Susan']

# Problem 12
# Research to find the Python method that allows you to add an element to the end of the array (similar to push() in JavaScript), then add a name to the end of the `friends` array.


# Problem 13
# Print out the total amount of elements in the `friends` array. The Python method you are looking for is similar to the JavaScript property `.length`.


# Problem 14
# Add a name into the third position in the array (index 2). Make sure you are not overwriting the value that is already there.


# Problem 15
# Remove the last item in the array (try to think about how you can do this dynamically, meaning, if the array contents were to change, your code would still work).
